# Abalone_Regression_Analysis

Developed a Simple Regression Model to predict abalone age based on physical features (length, diameter, weight).

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, reducing data complexity while preserving important variance.

Tested for heteroskedasticity using the White test, ensuring model assumptions were met and enhancing model reliability.

Documented detailed explanations for each technique, covering the mathematical principles, assumptions, and practical applications of the methods used.
